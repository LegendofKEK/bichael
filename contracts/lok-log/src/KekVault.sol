///             vault KEK balance >= sum of all in-game KEK counters
///         Deposits are pulled from the player and enter the log as an inbound event. Withdrawals are decreases the
///         verifier attested in a checkpoint. Because a withdrawal moves real tokens (a compromised signer would be
///         theft, not just inflation), they are delayed and freezable:
///           - queueWithdrawal refuses to queue more than this token deposited, minus withdrawals already reserved
///             (pending or claimed). Another character's KEK in the same vault cannot be queued.
///           - queueWithdrawal also refuses to queue more than the vault holds
///           - claims wait `withdrawDelay`, during which the guardian can cancel
///           - cancelled funds stay in the vault and release that token's reservation; admin can restore a false positive
