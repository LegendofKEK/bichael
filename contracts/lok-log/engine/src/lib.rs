//! Bellgrave lok engine.
//!
//! Proven against the golden vectors in `contracts/lok-log/test/Golden.t.sol` and
//! `test/golden/verify.mjs`. The game server calls this crate (wasm gate) for every item and KEK move.
//! KEK is deposit-only: a character log credits it only as a vault deposit, and
//! transfers cannot create it. `WithdrawKek` decreases spendable KEK and does not
//! submit an onchain withdrawal. `SpendKek` debits spendable KEK for an in-game
//! price, leaves escrowed bids locked, is not `kekOut`, and does not mint.
//! Level-up, ability, craft, harvest, and item-drop events are per character and
//! do not mint KEK. Each character has their own hash chain.
//! A KEK deposit or item import carries that character's inbound nonce and is rejected
//! if the same nonce is applied again. The nonce must be the next one (`inboundCount`).
